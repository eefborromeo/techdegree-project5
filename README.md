# techdegree-project5

This is my submission for Project 5: Web Style Guide. I received an Exceeds Expectations grade for this project.

In this project, I created a sass project using partials, variables, extends, mixins, and BEM classes to apply the aesthetic in the mockups to a style guide that explains each style.
